manage.py
=========

Create a simple CLI based on the contents of a manage.py module.

`manage.py` was created to create similar functionality to Django's manage.py for Flask apps. When `manage.py` is run, it looks at all of the functions defined at the top of the file, tries to run one, displays help, or shows a CLI summary.

**Note:** manage.py is not meant to generate a CLI for an end user of a normal app. It is meant to be used to create a programmer friendly CLI to control a web application.

As an example of a good manage.py file for a Flask web application,

````python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import project


def runserver():
    """ Start the server """

    project.run()

def createdb(drop=False):
    """
    Create the tables needed to run the application

    If drop is True, then all tables will first be dropped. THIS DESTROYS ALL DATA IN THE DATABASE.
    """

    if drop:
        project.db.drop_all()

    project.db.create_all()

def mkstaff(email, password, fname, lname, utype='staff'):
    """
    Create a new staff user

    This user will be able to access /admin routes and edit things. By default, creates a 'staff' user, not an 'admin'.
    """

    staff = User(email, password, fname, lname, utype)
    project.db.add(staff)
    project.db.commit()

````

If `manage.py` is run, the following output will be generated

````
Usage: manage.py [help] command [args...]
    createdb    Create the tables needed to run the application
    mkstaff     Create a new staff user
    runserver   Start the server
````

Running `manage.py mkstaff`, which does not have the reqired arguments, or `manage.py help mkstaff` displays

````
Usage manage.py mkstaff <email> <password> <fname> <lname> [utype=staff]

    Create a new staff user

    This user will be able to access /admin routes and edit things. By default, creates a 'staff' user, not an 'admin'.
